<pre><p>Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[7] on July 5, 1994.
Initially an online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories: 
a strategy that has earned it the moniker The Everything Store.[8] It has multiple subsidiaries including
Amazon Web Services (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet),
and Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and 
Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially
increased its footprint as a physical retailer.<p></pre>
